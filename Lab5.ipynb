    "The data set we selected is titled \"Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey\". It is a yearly survey collected by Stack Overflow where the developer community is asked questions that range from education, job satisfaction, views on AI, adverstising, ethics, and even stack overflow itself, and general sleeping and eating habits. There were more than 100,000 responses to the survey but there were only 67,441 responses that were completed and did not contain personally identifying information. \n",

    "There are two .csv files that below to this dataset. The first file (survey_results_public.csv) contains all the responses to the questions asked in the survey and the second file (survey_results_schema.csv) contains the question the goes with each column in the first file. For example, the column 'Hobby' contains all the responses to the question 'Do you code as a hobby?'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several job seach companies, like Indeed and ZipRecruiter, who could use data from a survey like this to help find more customers. Meaning they could take this data, try to determine which types of features correlate to a developer currently looking for a job, and better understand who they should be connecting with to say 'Hey, we think you might be looking for a job, and here are some jobs that you may be interested in!'.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that in order for companies like Indeed to find our model useful, we need to be precise more than half of the time. That just means that our model needs to be able to predict and be right more than half of time so that it would be better than just guessing.\n",

    "* Classification task: Classify a developer's job search status as either not interested in new job opportunites, not actively searching but open to hearing about job opportunites, or actively searching for new job opportunities."

    "There are a total of 129 features in the dataset. To help with time and complexity of building the models to classify whether a developer is currently searching for a job, we decided to drop a lot of the features for a several reasons. (1) There were a couple columns that we felt would have no affect on the model and the prediction task including 'Respondent', which was just a unique number for each developer who completed the survey and 'IDE' which contained all the responses to which IDEs the developer used. (2) There were a lot of questions that asked the developer to rank certain values in order of importance, like prefered way to be contacted at work, how they felt about a particular advertisment, or how they thought stack overflow could improve. We felt that these features would not have an affect on the model/prediction task. (3) __HERE__\n",

If developers are unhappy with their current job, are they more likely to be looking for a job and do the number of dependents and age also affect whether they are looking for a new job?\n",

    "We will be creating groups of crossed columns in our data so that our model is able to memorize and pick up on certain patterns. We hope to train our model with these groups and see if there's any relationships that cause someone to actively search for a job and what those motivations might be. We understand that there might be outside factors that could also affect someone's desire for a new job, but we feel that the stackoverflow survey really captured the essence of a person and we picked the questions that are most relevant to us. As far as the groups go, we decided to look at Student and Country - so will a person being in school in Europe or any country in that matter, be interested in a job? We will also look at Hobby and Employment - so, does an individual code for fun and are they currently employed? The next group is JobSatisfaction, SkipMeals, AgreeDisagree1 - which deals with how satisfied or unsatisfied an individual is with their current job, how many meals they skip a week, and how well they get along with their peers at work (overall, reasons that could cause one to want to leave their job and search for a new one.). And lastly, we look at how satisfied an individual is with their career, where they see themselves in 5 years, if they have updated their resume recently, how they feel in relation to their peers in terms of efficiency, and how satisfied they are at work. We feel that by having these groups, we will have a better understanding of what could cause someone to want to look for a new job, or not want to get a new job since they're employed."

Our goal is to be able to predict whether a person is looking for a job, or not, or maybe just checking out what's out there - whatever it is, we want to help. In order to do that, we need to make sure that our model is precise - meaning that we're able to get close values, being consistent is key for us. But we also want to be accurate in predicting so getting the correct predictions each time. We will be using both accuracy and precision to measure the performance of our model in predicting a person's job search status."
