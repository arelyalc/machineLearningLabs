The table data we found contains the names of applications, their ratings, the genre, the version, and other relevant information to describe an app. This data could be relevant to other iOS app developers who are developing apps that are similar in genre, content rating, etc. and see what other apps did well or what they did poorly.\n",

This data was collected by grabbing the information from the App Store's API.\n",
